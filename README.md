# GraduationProject

This project is made up of three folders: Caffe, Code and Data.

The Caffe folder contains my caffe installation.
The Code folder contains my code and shell scripts.
The Data folder contains only the fooling image data while the ImageNet data
is about 160 GB.

To experiment with it you should add the desired ImageNet synsets to the Data 
folder by creating a new folder named with the synset code (i.e. n01501773).

For every fooling image the "distance" folder contains all similarity measures.
The similarity overviews can be seen in the folder "similarity_overviews".
